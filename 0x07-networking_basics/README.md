## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

## Types of Networks

### LAN Network

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network of interconnected computers within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus.

### WAN Network

A WAN (Wide Area Network) spans a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs. The internet is an example of a global WAN.

### Internet

The internet is a worldwide system of interconnected networks that use standardized communication protocols to link devices globally.

## MAC Address

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's network interface, crucial for communication within a network.

## IP Address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network. It serves for host identification and location addressing.

### Private and Public Addresses

IP addresses are categorized into private (used within a local network) and public (routable on the internet) addresses.

### IPv4 and IPv6

IPv4 addresses use a 32-bit numerical format, while IPv6 addresses use a 128-bit hexadecimal format, both facilitating communication across networks.

### Localhost

Localhost (127.0.0.1) refers to the loopback address, allowing a device to communicate with itself.

## TCP and UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols, each with specific characteristics in data transmission.

### TCP/UDP Ports List

Ports are used by TCP and UDP to distinguish different services. Explore a comprehensive list of commonly used TCP/UDP ports.

## Ping/ICMP

Ping is a utility that sends an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request to check the availability of a network host.

## Positional Parameters

Positional parameters in networking refer to the order in which command-line arguments are provided, influencing the behavior of network commands.
